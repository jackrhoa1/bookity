# **Bookity**

## This web app gives users a medium to save, rate, tag, and search for books across an expansive library.

Users can search for books based keywords in titles and add the resulting books to their library.

Users can rate and add custom tags—including emojis–to these books. Users can also mark the status of the book as to-read, currently reading, and read.

Other information about the books, such as page count and year published, is visible from within the library.

All users have their own login information to access and append books to their personal library.
